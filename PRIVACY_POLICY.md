I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. This app was created using the Expo React Native app framework. No unique device identifiers or personal data are sent off of the user's device. PHQ-9 scores taken in the app are encrpted and stored locally on the user's device. This app does not require any permissions other than those listed below, and does not send notifications or require location. Please email ankitfoundationcorp@gmail.com if you have any questions or conconcerns.


The following permission are used:
android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE is an install-time permission that gives access to information about networks,
android.permission.INTERNET gives access to the internet
android.premission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is required for the score tracking features but does not access other data on the device
android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW is used for in-app alert popups
android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC is not directly used by the app but is a feature offered by the storage package that encrypts local data; the package offers securing the saved data using biometrics but as previously stated this feature is not leverage by this app
android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT is the same case as the previous permission
android.permission.VIBRATE allows access to haptic feedback
android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allows for the app to store previous PHQ-9 scores on device
com.google.android.finsky.permission.BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE helps track app installs and is part of the Google Play Referrer API
